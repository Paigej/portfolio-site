With the growth of the gaming industry, it’s becoming increasingly obvious that there are gaps in the affordances and considerations provided to people outside of the ‘traditional’ gaming demographics. One of these gaps is in physical input devices and how they can cause or exacerbate hand and wrist pain and fatigue. 


# Goals

My goal for this project was to **enable people who end their gameplay sessions due to hand and wrist pain or fatigue to play video games as long for longer**. My focus on achieving this goal was twofold:
1. To understand and learn some of the common causes of hand and wrist pain in gaming.
2. Develop a prototype to help ease the barriers that some players face due to hand and wrist pain. 


# Motivations

The Video Game Industry is the fastest growing segment of the entertainment industry.  According to a research study by Market Research Future, “Video Game Market information by Gaming Device, by Gaming Type, by End-user and Region – forecast to 2027” the market was valued at 155.9 billion in 2019, and is poised to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 14.5% by 20261.  Video games have been traditionally thought of as having a user base that is dominated by young, male players. A perspective and reality that’s now changing3. With these changes comes exciting opportunities to design for new groups and users that had previously been on the sidelines.

For identifying areas of growth and new users in gaming, one trend to take into consideration is the growth of the average age of gamer. The average age of gamers is increasing as young gamers age and as more adults and older adults play games2. There are many factors to take into account for design considerations for older adults. For this project, we can take into consideration that older adults tend to experience more health conditions related to hand and wrist pain, like arthritis4.  The CDC predicts that the prevalence of doctor-diagnosed arthritis is expected to increase in the coming decades4. Although there is not much research on how many people experience hand and wrist pain while gaming, we can only hypothesize that it will grow and become more prevalent. 
 Paired with the pressure and drive from within the industry to be more inclusive -  I believe there is an opportunity to take a closer look at different input devices and how different users can have a mismatch between the physical input devices and the comfort and safety of using them. 

Pain in the hands and/or wrists, as well as discomfort is only going to become more and more important as time goes on. However this problem isn’t only a consideration for older gamers. People of all ages can experience hand and wrist pain or fatigue. It’s important to consider all people, including those with disabilities that can lead to this type of fatigue or pain, in this project.

# Formative Research

Initial research helped me to narrow down and scope my design and research questions. I began this project with an open ended research question: of players who play games and face barriers that end their gameplay sessions before they want to, why?
I wanted to look for a barrier that I could center this project around. I was looking for:
- Barriers that multiple people experienced in similar ways
- Barriers that are a broad issues rather than being related to a specific game
- Barriers that I could reasonably research and prototype solutions for in a 10 week timeframe

I conducted a survey with the aim of gathering data to help categorize and investigate high level findings for different game session barriers. My goal was to help narrow down on a specific barrier to focus on for this project, and to establish a list of people that were interested in participating further.

The survey was primarily shared on twitter, and circulated amongst the gaming and disability community.  For context on the respondents, only 7 of the 105 participants responded that they never end gameplay sessions before they would like to. 

The most frequent cause that interrupted game sessions was “External Factors, followed by Stress and Emotional Fatigue, and finally Physical Pain. Additional causes mapped closely to the main cause that people experienced.

 
External factors was the only category that did not seem to be affected much by genre.  However, respondents did describe how games could provide affordances (e.g. “pausing”) to help keep the external factor from becoming something that ends the session.
