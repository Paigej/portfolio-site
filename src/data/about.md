# Intro

I am a UX Designer, maker, skier, coffee addict, video game enthusiast, and a huge proponent of sweatpants. I love finding joy in the people that I'm surrounded by, and trying to bring that same joy to others. I live everyday striving to find what I have to offer the people around me and how I can live that out. 
            
# Currently

You will find me as a Technical UX Designer at 343 Industries working on Halo Infinite. 

# Some history

- I grew up on a cattle ranch in Northeaster Colorado.

# Fun facts

- I only had eleven students in my graduating class from high school.
- I've built a sculpture of a dragon out of sheet steel and over 1000 CDs.
- I took two semesters of Chinese in Undergrad. Every once in a while my brain can translate characters I see into phonetic sounds (even if I don't remember meaning anymore).
- I use Dark Mode and Night Light on everything I possibly can. I even added Dark Mode to this site using [this React Hook](https://www.npmjs.com/package/use-dark-mode).
