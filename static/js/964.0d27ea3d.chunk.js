I love finding joy in the people that I'm surrounded by, and trying to bring that same joy to others. I live everyday striving to find what I have to offer the people around me and how I can live that out. \n            \n# Currently\n\nYou will find me as a Technical UX Designer at 343 Industries working on Halo Infinite. \n\n# Some history\n\n- I grew up on a cattle ranch in Northeastern Colorado. \n- I have my undergraduate degree in Computer Science from the University of Colorado in Boulder.\n- I have my Masters Degree in Human Centered Design and Engineering from the University of Washington.\n\n# I like\n\n- Skiing (both water and snow)\n- Coffee\n- Welding \n- Woodworking\n- Dogs; no I don't have one :(\n- Dragons; also don't have one :(\n- Video games that make me have \"holy snap\" moments \n\n\n# Fun facts\n\n- I only had eleven students in my graduating class from high school.\n- I've built a sculpture of a dragon out of sheet steel and over 1000 CDs.\n- I took two semesters of Chinese in Undergrad. Every once in a while my brain can translate characters I see into phonetic sounds (even if I don't remember meaning anymore).\n- I use Dark Mode and Night Light on everything I possibly can. I even added Dark Mode to this site using [this React Hook](https://www.npmjs.com/package/use-dark-mode). \n\n# Favorite Games\n- Outer Wilds [(yes I totally wrote one of my graduate school papers on it.)](../pdfs/The_Ship_Log_in_Outer_Wilds.pdf?target=\"_blank\")\n- Spyro The Dragon\n- Skyrim \n- Oblivion \n- Crash Team Racing\n- The Last of Us (1&2)\n\n\n",u=l.split(/\s+/).map((function(e){return e.replace(/\W/g,"")})).filter((function(e){return e.length})).length,c=function(e){var n=Object.assign({},((0,a.Z)(e),e));return(0,h.jsx)(r.rU,(0,o.Z)({},n))};n.default=function(){return(0,h.jsx)(d.Z,{title:"About",description:"Learn about Paige Cuthbertson",children:(0,h.jsxs)("article",{className:"post markdown",id:"about",children:[(0,h.jsx)("header",{children:(0,h.jsxs)("div",{className:"title",children:[(0,h.jsx)("h2",{"data-testid":"heading",children:(0,h.jsx)(r.rU,{to:"/about",children:"About Me"})}),(0,h.jsxs)("p",{children:["(in about ",u," words)"]})]})}),(0,h.jsx)(s(),{source:l,renderers:{Link:c},escapeHtml:!1})]})})}}}]);
