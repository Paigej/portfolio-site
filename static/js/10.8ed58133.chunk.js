Over the years I gradually took on more and more UX Design and Implementation work as an unofficial part of my job. Starting in late 2021 I officially transitioned to Technical UX Design. At 343i, we don\u2019t split UX Design and Technical Implementation, so Technical UX Designers will work through the whole pipeline for UX/UI.\n\n<div class="imgFlex">\n    <p>A breakdown of these responsibilities and a deeper dive into the projects I\'ve worked on as a Designer for Halo Infinite can be found on Figma, please contact me if you\'re interested in reviewing.</p>\n    <a href="https://www.figma.com/file/6uKG8iuSxzFTcZlr3AgYbc/Halo-Infinite-Portfolio?node-id=137%3A7" style="width:100%;padding:5%">\n        <img style="max-width: 100%;" class="displayInLight" src="/images/portfolio/Halo/Figma_Logo_Light.svg" alt="alt text placeholder">\n        <img style="max-width: 100%;" class="displayInDark" src="/images/portfolio/Halo/Figma_Logo_Dark.svg" href="" alt="alt text placeholder">\n    </a>\n</div>\n\n<div class="link-to" id="accessibility lead"></div>\n\n# Accessibility Lead\nStarting late 2018, I became the Accessibility Lead for the studio. My responsibilities included working with the Xbox Accessibility team on getting our title compliant with the CVAA and our own internal standards. Due to a lack of UX Design capacity, I also stepped into an Accessibility UX Designer role to help design some of our accessible systems. As of now I am the studio Accessibility Design Lead, and I\u2019ve handed off the production side of the job.\n\n<div class="imgFlex">\n    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVItZfE0FFY&t=1677s" style="width:45%;padding:0 5%">\n        <img style="max-width: 100%;" src="/images/portfolio/Halo/Showcase.png" alt="alt text placeholder">\n    </a>\n    <div style="vertical-align:top;width:60%">\n    <h4 style="width:100%;padding-left:5%">Xbox Accessibility Showcase</h4>\n    <p style="width:100%;padding:0 5%">Leading up to our initial release, I was interviewed to talk about our Accessibility and Inclusion settings.\n    </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n<div class="imgFlex">\n    <a href="https://youtu.be/w0EchHEvB_s?t=4004" style="width:45%;padding:0 5%">\n        <img style="max-width: 100%;" src="/images/portfolio/Halo/VGAA.png" alt="alt text placeholder">\n    </a>\n    <div style="vertical-align:top;width:60%">\n    <h4 href="https://youtu.be/w0EchHEvB_s?t=4004"style="width:100%;padding-left:5%">Video Game Accessibility Awards</h4>\n    <p style="width:100%;padding:0 5%">Halo Infinite won the \u201cClear Text\u201d Award, from the VGAA.

I ran production for the UX Design, UI Art, and UI Engineering disciplines.  In early 2019, along with the disciplines leads, I put together a presentation to restructure into a wholistic UX/UI team, which included a new process where we would engage with partner teams across the studio.  I ran production on the team, eventually taking on three Associate Producers to manage and distribute the work.  I established a roadmap and feature prioritization across the product, as well as a quality bar for our initial release. In starting late 2020, I managed a new Producer and came up with a transition plan to take over the Production Lead of the team from me so that I could officially transition to UX Design.',renderers:{Link:r},escapeHtml:!1})]})})}}}]);
