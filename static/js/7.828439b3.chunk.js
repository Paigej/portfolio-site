I love finding joy in the people that I'm surrounded by, and trying to bring that same joy to others. I live everyday striving to find what I have to offer the people around me and how I can live that out. \n            \n# Currently\n\nYou will find me as a Technical UX Designer at 343 Industries working on Halo Infinite. \n\n# Some history\n\n- I grew up on a cattle ranch in Northeastern Colorado. \n- I have my undergraduate degree in Computer Science from the University of Colorado in Boulder.\n- I shipped Halo Infinite in December 2021. \n- I have my Masters Degree in Human Centered Design and Engineering from the University of Washington.\n\n# I like\n\n- Skiing (both water and snow)\n- Coffee\n- Welding/Woodworking\n- 3D Modeling/Printing\n- Dogs; no I don't have one :(\n- Dragons; also don't have one :(\n- Video games that make me have \"holy snap\" moments \n\n# Fun facts\n\n- I only had eleven students in my graduating class from high school.\n- I've built a sculpture of a dragon out of sheet steel and over 1000 CDs.\n- I took two semesters of Chinese in Undergrad.

I even added Dark Mode to this site using [this React Hook](https://www.npmjs.com/package/use-dark-mode). \n\n# (Some of) my Favorite Games\n- Outer Wilds [(yes I totally wrote one of my graduate school papers on it.)](../pdfs/The_Ship_Log_in_Outer_Wilds.pdf?target=\"_blank\")\n- Spyro The Dragon\n- Crash Team Racing\n- Skyrim \n- Oblivion \n- The Last of Us (1&2)\n\n\n",l=h.split(/\s+/).map((function(e){return e.replace(/\W/g,"")})).filter((function(e){return e.length})).length,c=function(e){var n=Object.assign({},e);return Object(o.jsx)(a.b,Object(i.a)({},n))};n.default=function(){return Object(o.jsx)(d.a,{title:"About",description:"Learn about Paige Johnson",children:Object(o.jsxs)("article",{className:"post markdown",id:"about",children:[Object(o.jsx)("header",{children:Object(o.jsxs)("div",{className:"title",children:[Object(o.jsx)("h2",{"data-testid":"heading",children:Object(o.jsx)(a.b,{to:"/about",children:"About Me"})}),Object(o.jsxs)("p",{children:["(in about ",l," words)"]})]})}),Object(o.jsx)(s.a,{source:h,renderers:{Link:c},escapeHtml:!1})]})})}}}]);
