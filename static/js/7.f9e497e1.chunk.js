I love finding joy in the people that I'm surrounded by, and trying to bring that same joy to others. I live everyday striving to find what I have to offer the people around me and how I can live that out. \n            \n# Currently\n\nYou will find me as a Technical UX Designer at 343 Industries working on Halo Infinite. \n\n# Some history\n\n- I grew up on a cattle ranch in Northeaster Colorado. \n- I have my undergraduate degree in Computer Science from the University of Colorado in Boulder.\n- I have my Masters Degree in Human Centered Design and Engineering from the University of Washington.\n\n# I like\n\n- Skiing (both water and snow)\n- Coffee\n- Welding \n- Woodworking\n- Dogs; no I don't have one :(\n- Dragons; also don't have one :(\n- Video games that make me have \"holy snap\" moments \n\n\n# Fun facts\n\n- I only had eleven students in my graduating class from high school.\n- I've built a sculpture of a dragon out of sheet steel and over 1000 CDs.\n- I took two semesters of Chinese in Undergrad.
